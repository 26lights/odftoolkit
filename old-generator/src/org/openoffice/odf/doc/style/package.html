        Provides the classes necessary for the style handling during the parsing process 
        of ODF Documents. 
        
        These handlers are registered at the SAX parser and process document styles 
        as well as automatic styles. 
        <p>
        The ODFAutoStylePool manages the use of automatic styles.
        It holds two collections, one with objects of class OdfStyle, the other contains
        Objects of OdfListStyle. E.g. if a new automatic style is created,
        we can look up whether it has been used before. If so, it is already created 
        and can be referenced by a formerly given name. Otherwise a new automatic style
        will be created and added to the style pool.
